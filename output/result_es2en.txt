translate: The other role that performance on my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.     target: The other hat that I've worn in my work  is as an activist,  as a patient advocate --  or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate --  for people who are patients of doctors.
translate: In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics challenge social standards.     target: In that case, what I've worked with  is people who have body types  that challenge social norms.
translate: I've been working for example, with <unk> twins two people within one single body.     target: So some of what I've worked on, for example,  is people who are conjoined twins --  two people within one body.
translate: I've been working with people with <unk> people so much higher than the average.     target: Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism --  so people who are much shorter than typical.
translate: And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> sex -- individuals whose physical donors. It doesn't fit into male <unk> <unk>     target: And a lot of what I've worked on  is people who have atypical sex --  so people who don't have the standard male  or the standard female body types.
translate: In general lines we can <unk> <unk>     target: And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this.
translate: <unk> takes a lot of different forms.     target: Intersex comes in a lot of different forms.
translate: I'm going to give you a few examples in ways of having a sex that is not <unk> in the male or male or female.     target: I'll just give you a few examples  of the types of ways you can have sex  that isn't standard for male or female.
translate: For example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> <unk> which <unk> gene <unk> and he tells the <unk> that we all have in <unk> life that will become <unk>     target: So in one instance,  you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis,  and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome  tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life,  to become testes.
translate: And then, in life -- the testicles produce testosterone.     target: And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone.
translate: But given that this individual doesn't get on testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.     target: But because this individual lacks receptors  to hear that testosterone,  the body doesn't react to the testosterone.
translate: It's <unk> syndrome.     target: And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
translate: So, there are high <unk> levels, but not reaction.     target: So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.
translate: As a result, the body is growing up in a Japanese course.     target: As a consequence, the body develops  more along the female typical path.
translate: When you look at the baby has a little girl.     target: When the child is born, she looks like a girl.
translate: It's a child. It's raised as a child.     target: She is a girl. She is raised as a girl.
translate: And so often, it's not until puberty, when you're growing and developing the breast, but you don't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is going on.     target: And it's often not until she hits puberty  and she's growing and developing breasts,  but she's not getting her period,  that somebody figures out something's up here.
translate: Then they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and a <unk>     target: And they do some tests and figure out  that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus,  she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.
translate: The important thing to understand is that you can think that it's a man, but it's actually not that way.     target: Now what's important to understand  is you may think of this person as really being male,  but they're really not.
translate: Women like men, we have a little bit of the body called <unk> <unk>     target: Females, like males,  have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.
translate: They're in the back of the body.     target: They're in the back of our body.
translate: <unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>     target: And the adrenal glands make androgens,  which are a masculinizing hormone.
translate: Most of the women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman, he doesn't know his <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>     target: Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female --  I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up  but I think I'm probably typical --  most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
translate: We are producing <unk> and we respond to the <unk>     target: We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.
translate: As a consequence, someone like me has the smaller brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.     target: The consequence is that somebody like me  has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens  than the woman born with testes  who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.
translate: That's why sex is hard. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some ways you can be everywhere.     target: So sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people  are in the middle of all the sex spectrum --  in some ways, they can be all over the place.
translate: Another example: a few years ago, I received a call from a 19 guy born and raised and raised as <unk> and she had girlfriend, and sex relations with her, he had a life like a guy and had just learned that he had <unk> and <unk>     target: Another example:  a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old,  who was born a boy, raised a boy,  had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend,  had a life as a guy  and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.
translate: He had an extreme form of the disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>     target: What he had was an extreme form  of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
translate: It had <unk> and in the <unk> the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone environment.     target: He had XX chromosomes,  and in the womb,  his adrenal glands were in such high gear  that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.
translate: As a result, their <unk> were exposed to the brain was exposed to the hormone of hormone typically a male.     target: And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed,  his brain was subject  to the more typical masculine component of hormones.
translate: He was he was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.     target: And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything.
translate: And it was at the age of 19 when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was woman inside.     target: And it was only when he had reached the age of 19  that he began to have enough medical problems  actually from menstruating internally,  that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally.
translate: Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>     target: Okay, so just one more quick example  of a way you can have intersex.
translate: So some people with 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> which is they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.     target: Some people who have XX chromosomes  develop what are called ovotestis,  which is when you have ovarian tissue  with testicular tissue wrapped around it.
translate: We don't know why that happens.     target: And we're not exactly sure why that happens.
translate: So there are many varieties of sex.     target: So sex can come in lots of different varieties.
translate: The reason that children with this kind of bodies -- whether they're <unk> <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> <unk> surgery is not to be able to have a better physical health.     target: The reason  that children with these kinds of bodies --  whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning,  or it's an intersex type --  are often normalized by surgeons  is not because it actually leaves them better off  in terms of physical health.
translate: In many cases people are perfectly healthy.     target: In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.
translate: The reason that you get to a number of surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.     target: The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries  is because they threaten our social categories.
translate: The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.     target: Or system has been based typically on the idea  that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.
translate: We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity -- to be black is meant to have African anatomy in historical terms.     target: So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman  is to have a female identity;  what it means to be a black person is, allegedly,  is to have an African anatomy  in terms of your history.
translate: A terribly simplistic. idea.     target: And so we have this terribly simplistic idea.
translate: And when you show us a body that shows something pretty different, we have problems with the <unk>     target: And when we're faced with a body  that actually presents us something quite different,  it startles us in terms of those categorizations.
translate: So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>     target: So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture  about individualism.
translate: Our nation is based on a concept of a very romantic <unk>     target: And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.
translate: Imagine the amazing thing that is having children who are born as two people are born in one body.     target: Well you can imagine how startling then it is  when you have children that are born  who are two people inside of one body.
translate: The most deeper case is from the past year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was put on their sex in the <unk> <unk> <unk>     target: Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently  was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya,  had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
translate: A lot of journalists called the question, "What test are they going to do to determine whether they <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>     target: I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me,  "Which is the test they're going to run  that will tell us whether or not  Caster Semenya is male or female?"
translate: And I had to explain to the journalists that don't exist as a test.     target: And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.
translate: And in fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trigger a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and women and women are we who draw that line.     target: In fact, we now know  that sex is complicated enough  that we have to admit  nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female,  or between male and intersex and female and intersex;  we actually draw that line on nature.
translate: So, what we have is a situation where the more we do to the science, more we have to admit that these categories -- -- that we thought were <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with categories of <unk> <unk> they're much more <unk> than <unk>     target: So what we have is a sort of situation  where the farther our science goes,  the more we have to admit to ourselves  that these categories  that we thought of as stable anatomical categories  that mapped very simply  to stable identity categories  are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.
translate: And not only in terms of sex.     target: And it's not just in terms of sex.
translate: Also in terms of race, something that happens so much more complicated than the terminology <unk>     target: It's also in terms of race,  which turns out to be vastly more complicated  than our terminology has allowed.

translate: What do you <unk> from the fact that they are in just a few <unk>     target: What are we to make of the fact  that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides?
translate: And as we <unk> in science we get more and more in a awkward area in which we need to recognize that <unk> categories are probably too <unk>     target: And as we get farther and farther with our science,  we get more and more into a discomforted zone  where we have to acknowledge  that the simplistic categories we've had  are probably overly simplistic.
translate: And we are looking at this in all walks of human life.     target: So we're seeing this  in all sorts of places in human life.
translate: One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles to the beginning and in the end of life.     target: One of the places we're seeing it, for example,  in our culture today, in the United States today,  is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.

translate: But we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them into another body.     target: But today, we have a situation  where we want to take vital organs out of beings  and give them to other beings.
translate: And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of determine the death of anyone. And it puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.     target: And as a consequence,  we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question  about who's dead,  and this leads us to a really difficult situation  where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.
translate: And perhaps think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.     target: Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories  would make somebody like me really happy.

translate: This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.     target: This is a representation of your brain,  and your brain can be broken into two parts.
translate: The left-hand side -- which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.     target: There's the left half, which is the logical side,  and then the right half,  which is the intuitive.
translate: So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a plane of our brain.     target: And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,  then we can plot our brain.
translate: For example, this would be a completely logical thing.     target: And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.

translate: It's not that it's mutually <unk>     target: It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.
translate: You can be logical and intuitive.     target: You can be logical and intuitive.
translate: I consider myself one of those people, which as most of the other quantum physical physicists -- we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.     target: And so I consider myself one of these people,  along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists,  who need a good deal of logic  to string together these complex ideas.
translate: But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make experiments really work.     target: But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition  to actually make the experiments work.
translate: How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.     target: How do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff.
translate: We put it to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.     target: So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts,  and then we develop our intuition from there.
translate: And actually, you do the same thing.     target: And really you do the same thing.
translate: A intuition that you can have developed over the age of the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in one place at the same time.     target: So some intuition  that you may have developed over the years  is that one thing is only in one place at a time.
translate: I mean, it can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>     target: I mean, it can sound weird to think about  one thing being in two different places at the same time,  but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.
translate: I remember looking at a child playing on a parking room.     target: And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.
translate: It was a small child, and he didn't make it very well, it always <unk>     target: He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.
translate: But I bet that play with that bar of a parking bar taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow them to <unk> them and stay in a place.     target: But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson,  and that's that large things don't let you get right past them,  and that they stay in one place.
translate: This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except to be a particle physicist.     target: And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world,  unless you're a particle physicist.
translate: It would be a terrible model for a particle physics, because they don't play with chicken <unk> play with these strange little particles.     target: It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist,  because they don't play with car stops,  they play with these little weird particles.
translate: And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.     target: And when they play with their particles,  they find they do all sorts of really weird things --  like they can fly right through walls,  or they can be in two different places at the same time.
translate: And so they wrote all of these things, and they called the quantum mechanics.     target: And so they wrote down all these observations,  and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.
translate: And at that point there was some of the physics -- a few years since, you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.     target: And so that's where physics was at a few years ago;  you needed quantum mechanics  to describe little, tiny particles.
translate: But you didn't need to describe the very great objects around us every day.     target: But you didn't need it  to describe the large, everyday objects around us.
translate: That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.     target: This didn't really sit well with my intuition,  and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.
translate: Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.     target: Well, I play with them sometimes,  but not very often.
translate: And I've never seen them.     target: And I've never seen them.
translate: I mean, never saw a <unk>     target: I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.
translate: But I didn't fit it right to my logic.     target: But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.
translate: Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics.     target: Because if everything is made up of little particles  and all the little particles  follow quantum mechanics,  then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?
translate: I don't find the reason why they shouldn't have been.     target: I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.
translate: And so I'd feel much better if I could somehow show that a common object is still the principles of quantum mechanics.     target: And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing  if we could somehow show  that an everyday object  also follows quantum mechanics.
translate: And that's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.     target: So a few years ago, I set off to do just that.
translate: And I did.     target: So I made one.
translate: This is the first object that you can see that it's been in a quantum mechanics.     target: This is the first object  that you can see  that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.
translate: And what we see here is a little computer chip.     target: So what we're looking at here  is a tiny computer chip.
translate: And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.     target: And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.
translate: That's the little piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.     target: And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.
translate: This is a picture of the object.     target: This is a photograph of the object.
translate: And here's how I'm going to expand a little bit. It's just in the center.     target: And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.
translate: And then here we make a good focus to the little <unk> of metal.     target: And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.
translate: What we see is a little little bit of metal -- with a chance of springboard and that <unk> up on a platform.     target: So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal,  and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.
translate: And then I did this almost the same way that you would have a computer chip.     target: And so I made this thing  in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.
translate: I went to a clean room with a chip <unk> and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.     target: I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer,  and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.
translate: For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this little hole in a <unk> form of swimming on the device.     target: For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine --  to make this swimming pool-shaped hole  underneath the device.
translate: This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but for it it needs a little bit of help.     target: This device has the ability  to be in a quantum superposition,  but it needs a little help to do it.
translate: So let me make an analogy.     target: Here, let me give you an analogy.
translate: You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a elevator full of people.     target: You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?
translate: I mean, when I'm in a elevator alone, I make all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up to get out of doing those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or actually, <unk>     target: I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things,  but then other people get on board  and I stop doing those things  because I don't want to bother them,  or, frankly, scare them.
translate: Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.     target: So quantum mechanics says  that inanimate objects feel the same way.
translate: The journey of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that happens to its side and the heat of the room.     target: The fellow passengers for inanimate objects  are not just people,  but it's also the light shining on it  and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.
translate: And so we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to make all the other ones.     target: And so we knew, if we wanted to see  this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically,  we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.
translate: And that's what we did.     target: And so that's what we did.
translate: It <unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and brought it all the air, and then put it down to a temperature of less than a degree above zero absolute zero.     target: We turned off the lights,  and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air,  and then we cooled it down  to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.
translate: Now, when you're just going to be in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free of acting as you want.     target: Now, all alone in the elevator,  the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.
translate: So we measured their movements.     target: And so we measured its motion.
translate: We found that it was moving in very strange ways.     target: We found it was moving in really weird ways.
translate: Instead of staying perfectly still, he was determined and the way that <unk> was like a breath in this way -- as a <unk> which expands and <unk>     target: Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating,  and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this --  like expanding and contracting bellows.
translate: And by giving you a <unk> <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and that you don't have to <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.     target: And by giving it a gentle nudge,  we were able to make it both vibrate  and not vibrate  at the same time --  something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.
translate: So what I'm telling you is a really fantastic thing.     target: So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.
translate: What does it mean that an <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?     target: What does it mean for one thing  to be both vibrating and not vibrating  at the same time?
translate: Let's think about atoms.     target: So let's think about the atoms.
translate: In one case, every trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.     target: So in one case:  all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal  are sitting still  and at the same time those same atoms  are moving up and down.
translate: It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>     target: Now it's only at precise times when they align.
translate: In the rest of the time they're <unk>     target: The rest of the time they're delocalized.
translate: It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.     target: That means that every atom  is in two different places at the same time,  which in turn means the entire chunk of metal  is in two different places.
translate: I think this is great.     target: I think this is really cool.
translate: Okay.     target: Really.
translate: It was <unk> on a clean room to do this for all those years -- because look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that little piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.     target: It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years  because, check this out,  the difference in scale  between a single atom and that chunk of metal  is about the same as the difference  between that chunk of metal and you.
translate: So if a only atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?     target: So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time,  that chunk of metal can be in two different places,  then why not you?
translate: I mean, it's my <unk> part of speech.     target: I mean, this is just my logical side talking.

translate: The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.     target: The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm  is actually quite simple.
translate: We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.     target: We don't want Iran to get the bomb.
translate: The greater asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk> in <unk>     target: Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons  is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.
translate: The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.     target: The gray boxes that you see,  these are real-time control systems.
translate: If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have lots of problems with <unk>     target: Now if we manage to compromise these systems  that control drive speeds and valves,  we can actually cause a lot of problems  with the centrifuge.
translate: The gray boxes are not using <unk> software are completely different technology.     target: The gray boxes don't run Windows software;  they are a completely different technology.
translate: But if we were able to put an cash <unk> virus in a portable computer used by an engineer to <unk> this gray, then we're ready.     target: But if we manage  to place a good Windows virus  on a notebook  that is used by a maintenance engineer  to configure this gray box,  then we are in business.
translate: This is the plan behind <unk>     target: And this is the plot behind Stuxnet.
translate: We started with a <unk> <unk>     target: So we start with a Windows dropper.
translate: The <unk> goes into the gray, hurts the <unk> and the electronic nuclear program is <unk> mission <unk> mission.     target: The payload goes onto the gray box,  damages the centrifuge,  and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed --  mission accomplished.
translate: It's easy, <unk>     target: That's easy, huh?
translate: So I want to tell you how we found this.     target: I want to tell you how we found that out.
translate: When we begin to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.     target: When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,  it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.
translate: The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> <unk> used multiple <unk>     target: The only thing that was known  is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,  used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.
translate: It seemed to want to do something with these architectural <unk> these control systems.     target: And it seemed to want to do something  with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.
translate: That was called the attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.     target: So that got our attention,  and we started a lab project  where we infected our environment with Stuxnet  and checked this thing out.
translate: So they went very weird things.     target: And then some very funny things happened.
translate: <unk> <unk> like a lab in the lab that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but he didn't want to eat.     target: Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat  that didn't like our cheese --  sniffed, but didn't want to eat.
translate: I had no sense for me.     target: Didn't make sense to me.
translate: And then to experience with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.     target: And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,  I realized, well, this is a directed attack.
translate: It's completely <unk>     target: It's completely directed.
translate: The <unk> is actively searching in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is effectively working on that <unk>     target: The dropper is prowling actively  on the gray box  if a specific configuration is found,  and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect  is actually running on that target.
translate: If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.     target: And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.
translate: So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>     target: So that really got my attention,  and we started to work on this  nearly around the clock,  because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.
translate: It could be, let's say for example, a power plant of the United States, or a chemical plant in Germany.     target: It could be, let's say for example,  a U.S. power plant,  or a chemical plant in Germany.
translate: Better that we would make the goal soon.     target: So we better find out what the target is soon."
translate: So we pulled out and <unk> the code, and we found that it was <unk> in two flying pumps -- a small one and a big one.     target: So we extracted and decompiled  the attack code,  and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs --  a smaller one and a bigger one.
translate: We also saw that they were very <unk> armed people, people who obviously had the whole internal information.     target: And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered  by people who obviously had all insider information.
translate: It would take all the points to attack.     target: They knew all the bits and bites  that they had to attack.
translate: You probably even know how much of it <unk> the operator.     target: They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.
translate: So you know everything.     target: So they know everything.
translate: And if you have heard that <unk> <unk> it's complex and high technology, let me tell you the load is very complex.     target: And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet  is complex and high-tech,  let me tell you this:  the payload is rocket science.
translate: It's very much above all what we've seen before.     target: It's way above everything  that we have ever seen before.
translate: Here you see a sample of this code of attack.     target: Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.
translate: We're talking about about 15 lines of code.     target: We are talking about --  around about 15,000 lines of code.
translate: It looks pretty much like old language.     target: Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language.
translate: So I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.     target: And I want to tell you how we were able  to make sense out of this code.
translate: What we was looking at was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.     target: So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,  because we know what they do.
translate: Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to <unk> them with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.     target: And then we were looking for timers and data structures  and trying to relate them to the real world --  to potential real world targets.
translate: We need <unk> theories we can pass or <unk>     target: So we do need target theories  that we can prove or disprove.
translate: And to get to theories on goals -- we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's probably in Iran, because it's where most of the infections have been <unk>     target: In order to get target theories,  we remember  that it's definitely hardcore sabotage,  it must be a high-value target  and it is most likely located in Iran,  because that's where most of the infections had been reported.
translate: You don't find a variety of targets in that area.     target: Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.
translate: It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant <unk> and the <unk> plant.     target: It basically boils down  to the Bushehr nuclear power plant  and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.
translate: So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and energy plants among our <unk>     target: So I told my assistant,  "Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base."
translate: I called them and asked them in an effort for <unk> your experience with what we find in code and data.     target: And I phoned them up and picked their brain  in an effort to match their expertise  with what we found in code and data.
translate: And it worked pretty good.     target: And that worked pretty well.
translate: So we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>     target: So we were able to associate  the small digital warhead  with the rotor control.
translate: Traffic is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.     target: The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,  that black object that you see.
translate: If you run the speed of this <unk> you certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>     target: And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,  you are actually able to crack the rotor  and eventually even have the centrifuge explode.
translate: What we also saw is that the center of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an absolute effort to get it crazy to <unk> engineers so you couldn't solve this quickly.     target: What we also saw  is that the goal of the attack  was really to do it slowly and creepy --  obviously in an effort  to drive maintenance engineers crazy,  that they would not be able to figure this out quickly.
translate: We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.     target: The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this  by looking very closely  at data and data structures.
translate: So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't afford it.     target: So for example, the number 164  really stands out in that code;  you can't overlook it.
translate: I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they are <unk> in what it's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>     target: I started to research scientific literature  on how these centrifuges  are actually built in Natanz  and found they are structured  in what is called a cascade,  and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.
translate: That was a sense, there was a coincidence.     target: So that made sense, that was a match.
translate: And he got better yet.     target: And it even got better.
translate: These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.     target: These centrifuges in Iran  are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.
translate: And guess what do we find in the code of <unk>     target: And guess what we found in the attack code?
translate: A almost <unk> structure.     target: An almost identical structure.
translate: So again, that was a good coincidence.     target: So again, that was a real good match.
translate: This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had between hands.     target: And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.
translate: So that there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.     target: Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.
translate: The results have been coming up from a number of weeks of hard work.     target: These results have been obtained  over several weeks of really hard labor.
translate: <unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to come back and start.     target: And we often went into just a dead end  and had to recover.
translate: Yet we discovered that both of the digital <unk> would be on one and same goal, but from different <unk>     target: Anyway, so we figured out  that both digital warheads  were actually aiming at one and the same target,  but from different angles.
translate: The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and doing the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> is communicating with six <unk> and manipulating it.     target: The small warhead is taking one cascade,  and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,  and the big warhead  is talking to six cascades  and manipulating valves.
translate: In <unk> we're very concerned about what we have determined is <unk>     target: So in all, we are very confident  that we have actually determined what the target is.
translate: It's <unk> and it's just <unk>     target: It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.
translate: We shouldn't worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>     target: So we don't have to worry  that other targets  might be hit by Stuxnet.
translate: Here I show you some really interesting things that we saw -- really <unk>     target: Here's some very cool stuff that we saw --  really knocked my socks off.
translate: There's the gray box and and the top you see the <unk>     target: Down there is the gray box,  and on the top you see the centrifuges.
translate: What this thing does is that does is <unk> the input values for example, from the pressure sensors and the sensor sensors and provide <unk> code, which still run during the attack with false <unk> data.     target: Now what this thing does  is it intercepts the input values from sensors --  so for example, from pressure sensors  and vibration sensors --  and it provides legitimate program code,  which is still running during the attack,  with fake input data.
translate: And believe it, or not, these false input data is <unk> by <unk>     target: And as a matter of fact, this fake input data  is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.
translate: It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera, <unk> <unk>     target: So it's just like from the Hollywood movies  where during the heist,  the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.
translate: <unk> <unk>     target: That's cool, huh?
translate: The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>     target: The idea here is obviously  not only to fool the operators in the control room.
translate: It's really much more dangerous and <unk>     target: It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.
translate: The idea is <unk> a digital security.     target: The idea  is to circumvent a digital safety system.
translate: We need digital security system where a human operator could not act fast.     target: We need digital safety systems  where a human operator could not act quick enough.
translate: For example, in a power plant, when the large steam vapor goes down, you have to open valves <unk> in a <unk>     target: So for example, in a power plant,  when your big steam turbine gets too over speed,  you must open relief valves within a millisecond.
translate: Obviously, this can't make it a human clinic.     target: Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.
translate: This is where we need digital security.     target: So this is where we need digital safety systems.
translate: And when they're <unk> then they can spend bad things.     target: And when they are compromised,  then real bad things can happen.
translate: The plant can <unk>     target: Your plant can blow up.
translate: And I didn't get the <unk> neither the security system <unk>     target: And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.
translate: That scares that.     target: That's scary.
translate: But it can be worse.     target: But it gets worse.
translate: What I'm going to say is very important.     target: And this is very important, what I'm going to say.
translate: Think of this. This attack is <unk>     target: Think about this:  this attack is generic.
translate: It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>     target: It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,  with centrifuges,  with uranium enrichment.
translate: It could work as well, for example, in a energy plant, or in a <unk>     target: So it would work as well, for example,  in a power plant  or in an automobile factory.
translate: It's <unk>     target: It is generic.
translate: And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this load with a key key, as we saw in the case of <unk>     target: And you don't have -- as an attacker --  you don't have to deliver this payload  by a USB stick,  as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.
translate: You can also use conventional <unk> technology for <unk>     target: You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.
translate: They were going to be more possible as possible.     target: Just spread it as wide as possible.
translate: And if you made that, with what <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.     target: And if you do that,  what you end up with  is a cyber weapon of mass destruction.
translate: That's the consequence that we need to face.     target: That's the consequence  that we have to face.
translate: Unfortunately, most targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.     target: So unfortunately,  the biggest number of targets for such attacks  are not in the Middle East.
translate: It's in the United States and in Japan.     target: They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.
translate: All of the green areas are in a large number of goals.     target: So all of the green areas,  these are your target-rich environments.
translate: We need to face the consequences and better than we are going to start doing now.     target: We have to face the consequences,  and we better start to prepare right now.
translate: Thank you.     target: Thanks.
translate: Chris Anderson: I have a question.     target: Chris Anderson: I've got a question.
translate: <unk> has been done in a lot of different sides that people assume that the <unk> is the main bit behind this.     target: Ralph, it's been quite widely reported  that people assume that Mossad  is the main entity behind this.
translate: What's your <unk>     target: Is that your opinion?
translate: Ralph <unk> OK, you really want to hear this?     target: Ralph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that?
translate: Yeah. <unk>     target: Yeah. Okay.
translate: My guess is that the <unk> is involved -- but the engine is not <unk>     target: My opinion is that the Mossad is involved,  but that the leading force is not Israel.
translate: The engine behind this is the <unk> <unk>     target: So the leading force behind that  is the cyber superpower.
translate: There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>     target: There is only one,  and that's the United States --  fortunately, fortunately.
translate: Because, in other ways, our problems would be even greater.     target: Because otherwise,  our problems would even be bigger.
translate: CA: Thank you for <unk> Thanks, <unk>     target: CA: Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you, Ralph.
translate: And I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give skills <unk> or somebody else to make users of the wheelchair raise and go back to walk.     target: I want you now to imagine  a wearable robot  that gives you superhuman abilities,  or another one that takes wheelchair users  up standing and walking again.
translate: In <unk> <unk> called these robots, <unk>     target: We at Berkeley Bionics  call these robots exoskeletons.
translate: It's nothing different from something that you put in the morning, gives you a great strength, which is also increase on your speed, and help, for example, to handle the balance.     target: These are nothing else  than something that you put on in the morning,  and it will give you extra strength,  and it will further enhance your speed,  and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.
translate: It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.     target: It is actually the true integration  of the man and the machine.
translate: But not just that -- it can integrate and connected to the universe and with other kinds of things.     target: But not only that --  it will integrate and network you  to the universe  and other devices out there.
translate: This is not a <unk> idea.     target: This is just not some blue sky thinking.
translate: Now to show you now in what we're working with, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, have to take over his back a charge of 45 pounds, and it was <unk> to take even more team.     target: To show you now what we are working on  by starting out talking about  the American soldier,  that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs,  and they are being asked to carry more equipment.
translate: And obviously, this leads to some of the important complications -- injuries in the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to the back.     target: Obviously, this is resulting  in some major complications --  back injuries, 30 percent of them --  chronic back injuries.

translate: So in order to achieve an realistic result I think we need planning.     target: So to achieve a realistic result,  I think it comes down to planning.
translate: You always start with an <unk> an idea.     target: It always starts with a sketch, an idea.
translate: And then we need to combine the different photographs.     target: Then it's about combining the different photographs.
translate: And here every piece is pretty well <unk>     target: And here every piece is very well planned.
translate: If you do a good job when you take the pictures that turns out it can be very beautiful and at a very <unk> time.     target: And if you do a good job capturing the photos,  the result can be quite beautiful  and also quite realistic.
translate: All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.     target: So all the tools are out there,  and the only thing that limits us  is our imagination.
translate: Thank you.     target: Thank you.
translate: I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.     target: So I'm going to start out  by showing just one very boring technology slide.
translate: Please if you can do it <unk>     target: And then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on.
translate: It's a diagram that I took out of a portfolio of mine.     target: This is just a random slide  that I picked out of my file.
translate: I'm not so interested in showing you the details -- but the general <unk>     target: What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide,  but the general form of it.
translate: This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of the <unk> <unk> versus the power of the local area.     target: This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing  about the power of RISC microprocessors  versus the power of local area networks.
translate: The interesting thing about this is that this one, like many other that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.     target: And the interesting thing about it  is that this slide,  like so many technology slides that we're used to,  is a sort of a straight line  on a semi-log curve.
translate: In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the <unk> scale.     target: In other words, every step here  represents an order of magnitude  in performance scale.
translate: I talk about technology with <unk> <unk> it's new.     target: And this is a new thing  that we talk about technology  on semi-log curves.
translate: So here's something strange.     target: Something really weird is going on here.
translate: And that's what I'm going to talk about.     target: And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about.
translate: Please light up the lights.     target: So, if you could bring up the lights.
translate: It's more intensity because writing on paper.     target: If you could bring up the lights higher,  because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.
translate: So why are we going to do technological curves in <unk> scales.     target: Now why do we draw technology curves  in semi-log curves?
translate: The answer is that if you draw it on a normal curve that we say, these are the years or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to make -- the diagram would look ridiculous.     target: Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve  where, let's say, this is years,  this is time of some sort,  and this is whatever measure of the technology  that I'm trying to graph,  the graphs look sort of silly.
translate: It would be something like this.     target: They sort of go like this.
translate: It doesn't tell a lot.     target: And they don't tell us much.
translate: But if you can take it for instance, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.     target: Now if I graph, for instance,  some other technology, say transportation technology,  on a semi-log curve,  it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line.
translate: But if it happens something like this, a <unk> change.     target: But when something like this happens,  things are qualitatively changing.
translate: If the technology of <unk> technology as quickly as the <unk> of <unk> we could be able to take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.     target: So if transportation technology  was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology,  then the day after tomorrow,  I would be able to get in a taxi cab  and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
translate: But it doesn't go through that rhythm.     target: It's not moving like that.
translate: There's no unprecedented in the history of technological growth that every few years advance orders of magnitude.     target: And there's nothing precedented  in the history of technology development  of this kind of self-feeding growth  where you go by orders of magnitude every few years.
translate: The question that I want to do is -- look at these curves -- we see that they don't follow forever.     target: Now the question that I'd like to ask is,  if you look at these exponential curves,  they don't go on forever.
translate: It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.     target: Things just can't possibly keep changing  as fast as they are.
translate: So let's take one of two things.     target: One of two things is going to happen.
translate: Or it's going to turn into a typical curve -- I know like this until it turns out something completely different, or maybe it's going to do something like this.     target: Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this,  until something totally different comes along,  or maybe it's going to do this.
translate: That's all that can happen.     target: That's about all it can do.
translate: I'm optimistic, that's why I think maybe something like this.     target: Now I'm an optimist,  so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.
translate: So now we would be in the middle of an transition.     target: If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now  is a transition.
translate: On this line we are in a transition of what the world used to be in a new way.     target: We're sort of on this line  in a transition from the way the world used to be  to some new way that the world is.
translate: So what I'm trying to ask, is what that new way you take the world?     target: And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself,  is what's this new way that the world is?
translate: Why new the world does the world?     target: What's that new state that the world is heading toward?
translate: The transition seems very, very heavy if we're engaged in it.     target: Because the transition seems very, very confusing  when we're right in the middle of it.
translate: I remember from child the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.     target: Now when I was a kid growing up,  the future was kind of the year 2000,  and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
translate: This is a conference that people are talking about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.     target: Now here's a conference  in which people talk about the future,  and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000.
translate: That's all we see.     target: It's about as far as we go out.
translate: In other words, the future has been spent year after a year throughout my life.     target: So in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking  one year per year  for my whole lifetime.
translate: But I think it's because we feel something is going on.     target: Now I think that the reason  is because we all feel  that something's happening there.
translate: And that happens to a transformation. We can feel it.     target: That transition is happening. We can all sense it.
translate: And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we are doing today doesn't have any sense.     target: And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense  to think out 30, 50 years  because everything's going to be so different  that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing  just doesn't make any sense at all.
translate: And so I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to be <unk>     target: So what I would like to talk about  is what that could be,  what that transition could be that we're going through.
translate: But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.     target: Now in order to do that  I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff  that really has nothing to do  with technology and computers.
translate: Because I think the only way to understand it is taking away and look at the long-term things.     target: Because I think the only way to understand this  is to really step back  and take a long time scale look at things.
translate: The time a scale of time I'd like to do this is the time of life on Earth.     target: So the time scale that I would like to look at this on  is the time scale of life on Earth.
translate: I think this picture makes sense if we look at each billion years.     target: So I think this picture makes sense  if you look at it a few billion years at a time.
translate: So you go back to about two million years when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with many chemicals that fit around them.     target: So if you go back  about two and a half billion years,  the Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock  with a lot of chemicals floating around on it.
translate: So if we look at the way these chemicals organized our chemical we give us an idea of how things happened.     target: And if you look at the way  that the chemicals got organized,  we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.
translate: And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. So I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is, at the time, I had floating on some oil <unk> with all kinds of plastic recipes in the inside.     target: And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand  about how it started with RNA,  but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it,  which is that, at that time,  there were little drops of oil floating around  with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.
translate: Some of those leaves out of the oil drops a particular combination of chemicals that did them bringing materials out of the outside and so <unk> grew together.     target: And some of those drops of oil  had a particular combination of chemicals in them  which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside  and grow the drops of oil.
translate: And they started <unk>     target: And those that were like that  started to split and divide.
translate: In a certain sense, those were the most important cell forms of the oil.     target: And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense,  those little drops of oil.
translate: But those strands were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.     target: But now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now,  because every one of them  was a little random recipe of chemicals.
translate: And every time he <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that <unk>     target: And every time it divided,  they got sort of unequal division  of the chemicals within them.
translate: So every single <unk> it was a bit different.     target: And so every drop was a little bit different.
translate: In fact, the drops that somehow will become better at the time of incorporate chemical <unk> <unk> more, <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>     target: In fact, the drops that were different in a way  that caused them to be better  at incorporating chemicals around them,  grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more.
translate: They often lived more time, they were more <unk>     target: So those tended to live longer,  get expressed more.
translate: It was a way of life, and chemical life, very simple, but things kind of really interesting things when these drops the trick of the abstraction.     target: Now that's sort of just a very simple  chemical form of life,  but when things got interesting  was when these drops  learned a trick about abstraction.
translate: Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.     target: Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand,  these little drops learned to write down information.
translate: They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.     target: They learned to record the information  that was the recipe of the cell  onto a particular kind of chemical  called DNA.
translate: In other words, <unk> in this evolution without sense, a system of writing that allowed them to register what they were to be able to <unk>     target: So in other words, they worked out,  in this mindless sort of evolutionary way,  a form of writing that let them write down what they were,  so that that way of writing it down could get copied.
translate: The incredible thing is that this writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved two million years ago.     target: The amazing thing is that that way of writing  seems to have stayed steady  since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.
translate: Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that kind of writing.     target: In fact the recipe for us, our genes,  is exactly that same code and that same way of writing.
translate: In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.     target: In fact, every living creature is written  in exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
translate: And one of the things that I did just for <unk> We can write things with this code.     target: In fact, one of the things that I did  just for amusement purposes  is we can now write things in this code.
translate: Here I have a hundred <unk> of white dust that trying to hide the security of the airport.     target: And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder,  which I try not to let the security people see at airports.
translate: But <unk> Tom this <unk> The code has the ordinary letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.     target: But this has in it --  what I did is I took this code --  the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it --  and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA  and amplified it 10 to the 22 times.
translate: So if somebody wants to be 100 million copies of my own personal card, I have lots of all of the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.     target: So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card,  I have plenty for everyone in the room,  and, in fact, everyone in the world,  and it's right here.
translate: If I were a <unk> I would have put it on a virus and it would have spread through the room.     target: If I had really been a egotist,  I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.
translate: What was the next <unk>     target: So what was the next step?
translate: And writing DNA was an interesting step.     target: Writing down the DNA was an interesting step.
translate: This was made that these cells were happy about another billion years.     target: And that caused these cells --  that kept them happy for another billion years.
translate: But then there was another big step that things turned out where things were <unk> and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicating information to form of cells.     target: But then there was another really interesting step  where things became completely different,  which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information,  so that they began to get communities of cells.
translate: I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.     target: I don't know if you know this,  but bacteria can actually exchange DNA.
translate: That way, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.     target: Now that's why, for instance,  antibiotic resistance has evolved.
translate: And some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are lots of resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate.     target: Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin,  and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information  with other bacteria,  and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin,  because bacteria communicate.
translate: This communication gave place to become the communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and there was a <unk>     target: Now what this communication allowed  was communities to form  that, in some sense, were in the same boat together;  they were synergistic.
translate: From that way, <unk> or <unk> them together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community became more and <unk> by evolution.     target: So they survived  or they failed together,  which means that if a community was very successful,  all the individuals in that community  were repeated more  and they were favored by evolution.
translate: And the inflection point happened when these communities came back so much that, in fact, they came together and they decided to write all the recipe for the community on a chain of DNA.     target: Now the transition point happened  when these communities got so close  that, in fact, they got together  and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community  together on one string of DNA.
translate: The next interesting stage for life took another one billion years.     target: And so the next stage that's interesting in life  took about another billion years.
translate: And in that stage we have communities <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.     target: And at that stage,  we have multi-cellular communities,  communities of lots of different types of cells,  working together as a single organism.
translate: In fact, we are a <unk> community.     target: And in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community.
translate: We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.     target: We have lots of cells  that are not out for themselves anymore.
translate: The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.     target: Your skin cell is really useless  without a heart cell, muscle cell,  a brain cell and so on.
translate: So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.     target: So these communities began to evolve  so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place  was no longer a cell,  but a community which we call an organism.
translate: The next level happened within these communities.     target: Now the next step that happened  is within these communities.
translate: These started <unk> information.     target: These communities of cells,  again, began to abstract information.
translate: And to build very special structures that they didn't make more that process in community.     target: And they began building very special structures  that did nothing but process information within the community.
translate: They're the <unk> structures.     target: And those are the neural structures.
translate: The neurons are the devices that process information that those mobile cell communities built.     target: So neurons are the information processing apparatus  that those communities of cells built up.
translate: In fact, they started <unk> inside the community being <unk> structures to understand and convey the information.     target: And in fact, they began to get specialists in the community  and special structures  that were responsible for recording,  understanding, learning information.
translate: Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.     target: And that was the brains and the nervous system  of those communities.
translate: And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.     target: And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
translate: Because at that moment as <unk> learning, learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the evolutionary period of time.     target: Because at that point,  an individual --  learning could happen  within the time span of a single organism,  instead of over this evolutionary time span.
translate: So, one organism could be able to learn not to eat a certain fruit because they knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.     target: So an organism could, for instance,  learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit  because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.
translate: That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years because of the death of individuals who ate their fruit <unk>     target: That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism,  whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures,  that would have had to be learned evolutionarily  over hundreds of thousands of years  by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.
translate: So the fact that the nervous system built out those <unk> information structures generated by the evolutionary process.     target: So that nervous system,  the fact that they built these special information structures,  tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution.
translate: Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.     target: Because evolution could now happen within an individual.
translate: It could happen in the time you need to learn.     target: It could happen in learning time scales.
translate: But then, of course, the individuals discovered the lack of communication.     target: But then what happened  was the individuals worked out,  of course, tricks of communicating.
translate: So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is the human language.     target: And for example,  the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.
translate: If you think about it, it's an incredible invention.     target: It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.
translate: I have a really complicated idea of an <unk> idea.     target: Here I have a very complicated, messy,  confused idea in my head.
translate: I'm here sitting now emitting a little bit of <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that would hold some analogy with mine.     target: I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically,  and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head  that bears some analogy to it.
translate: But we took something very complicated we become the sound sequences of sound, and we produce something very complicated in the other brain.     target: But we're taking something very complicated,  turning it into sound, sequences of sounds,  and producing something very complicated in your brain.
translate: That's now allowing us to start working as a organism.     target: So this allows us now  to begin to start functioning  as a single organism.
translate: In fact, as mankind, we've started to do <unk>     target: And so, in fact, what we've done  is we, humanity,  have started abstracting out.
translate: Now, we now went through similar periods of similar amounts of organisms that are <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.     target: We're going through the same levels  that multi-cellular organisms have gone through --  abstracting out our methods of recording,  presenting, processing information.
translate: For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.     target: So for example, the invention of language  was a tiny step in that direction.
translate: The <unk> the <unk> tape the video, the <unk> and so on, it's the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.     target: Telephony, computers,  videotapes, CD-ROMs and so on  are all our specialized mechanisms  that we've now built within our society  for handling that information.
translate: And that aggregate us into something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.     target: And it all connects us together  into something  that is much bigger  and much faster  and able to evolve  than what we were before.
translate: Now evolution can occur in time.     target: So now, evolution can take place  on a scale of microseconds.
translate: You know, you saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> where that produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.     target: And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example  where he sort of did a little bit of evolution  on the Convolution program right before your eyes.
translate: And now we've accelerated the time scales.     target: So now we've speeded up the time scales once again.
translate: The first stages of the history that I told you led to a billion years each.     target: So the first steps of the story that I told you about  took a billion years a piece.
translate: The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain took about hundreds of millions of years.     target: And the next steps,  like nervous systems and brains,  took a few hundred million years.
translate: <unk> the language and so they took less than a million years.     target: Then the next steps, like language and so on,  took less than a million years.
translate: And all the other days as the electronics, seems to take a few decades.     target: And these next steps, like electronics,  seem to be taking only a few decades.
translate: The process <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that cost its own pace of change.     target: The process is feeding on itself  and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it --  when something reinforces its rate of change.
translate: The more changes, the faster it does.     target: The more it changes, the faster it changes.
translate: And I think that's what we see in this curve.     target: And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.
translate: We see the process <unk>     target: We're seeing this process feeding back on itself.
translate: But I make a life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the scientific advances alone.     target: Now I design computers for a living,  and I know that the mechanisms  that I use to design computers  would be impossible  without recent advances in computers.
translate: But now design objects such that it would be impossible to me in a conventional way.     target: So right now, what I do  is I design objects at such complexity  that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.
translate: I don't know it makes every transistor in that machine of connections.     target: I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.
translate: There are billions of millions.     target: There are billions of them.
translate: Instead of that, with the <unk> designers -- we think of a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that never could, it gets much further and faster than never before.     target: Instead, what I do  and what the designers at Thinking Machines do  is we think at some level of abstraction  and then we hand it to the machine  and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do,  much farther and faster than we could ever do.
translate: In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand well.     target: And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods  that we don't quite even understand.
translate: A particularly interesting method that I've been using is the evolution itself.     target: One method that's particularly interesting  that I've been using a lot lately  is evolution itself.
translate: We put it into the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of time.     target: So what we do  is we put inside the machine  a process of evolution  that takes place on the microsecond time scale.
translate: And for example, in the more extreme cases we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.     target: So for example,  in the most extreme cases,  we can actually evolve a program  by starting out with random sequences of instructions.
translate: We say, please read a computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions <unk>     target: Say, "Computer, would you please make  a hundred million random sequences of instructions.
translate: You could run these sequences of instructions at random, run all those programs, and take those more <unk> to what we want to do?"     target: Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions,  run all of those programs,  and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted."
translate: In other words, I define what I want.     target: So in other words, I define what I wanted.
translate: Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.     target: Let's say I want to sort numbers,  as a simple example I've done it with.
translate: So we found the programs that are closer to <unk> numbers.     target: So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers.
translate: Of course, it's unlikely to have some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.     target: So of course, random sequences of instructions  are very unlikely to sort numbers,  so none of them will really do it.
translate: But one, luckily, he could put two numbers in the right order.     target: But one of them, by luck,  may put two numbers in the right order.
translate: And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that they best did the <unk>     target: And I say, "Computer,  would you please now take the 10 percent  of those random sequences that did the best job.
translate: <unk> those and <unk> the rest of them.     target: Save those. Kill off the rest.
translate: And now we <unk> those things better than <unk> the numbers.     target: And now let's reproduce  the ones that sorted numbers the best.
translate: And let's go back to <unk> following a <unk> process of analog to <unk>     target: And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination  analogous to sex."
translate: Let's take two programs, that <unk> kids, who are <unk> <unk> and that the children will <unk> the properties of both of both programs.     target: Take two programs and they produce children  by exchanging their subroutines,  and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs.
translate: So we get a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little longer success.     target: So I've got now a new generation of programs  that are produced by combinations  of the programs that did a little bit better job.
translate: And we go, "Please ask the <unk>     target: Say, "Please repeat that process."
translate: I would get it again.     target: Score them again.
translate: I would have some mutations to do.     target: Introduce some mutations perhaps.
translate: And he tries again to do with another generation.     target: And try that again and do that for another generation.
translate: Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.     target: Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds.
translate: So, I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or, in complicated cases, in a few hours.     target: So I can do the equivalent  of millions of years of evolution on that  within the computer in a few minutes,  or in the complicated cases, in a few hours.

translate: What you stood when there was six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>     target: Of the people who stopped when there were six,  well now we saw that 30 percent of them  actually bought a jar of jam.
translate: If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.     target: Now if you do the math,  people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam  if they encountered six  than if they encountered 24.
translate: Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> <unk> probably <unk> <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of <unk> choices affects us in good decisions.     target: Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam  is probably good for us --  at least it's good for our waistlines --  but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us  even in very consequential decisions.
translate: We decided we don't decide, even though this is not <unk>     target: We choose not to choose,  even when it goes against our best self-interests.
translate: Now, the theme of the day, the financial <unk>     target: So now for the topic of today: financial savings.
translate: I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at <unk> decisions for retirement savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.     target: Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did  with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang  where we looked at the retirement savings decisions  of nearly a million Americans  from about 650 plans  all in the U.S.
translate: And we were interested in looking at whether the number of funds available for savings plans for healthcare, the <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.     target: And what we looked at  was whether the number of fund offerings  available in a retirement savings plan,  the 401 plan,  does that affect people's likelihood  to save more for tomorrow.
translate: And we found out that there was a <unk>     target: And what we found  was that indeed there was a correlation.
translate: We had <unk> plans from two to 59 different options.     target: So in these plans, we had about 657 plans  that ranged from offering people  anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.
translate: We found that the older people was the number of funding, there were less participation.     target: And what we found was that,  the more funds offered,  indeed, there was less participation rate.
translate: So if you look at the extreme extreme, we see that in the plans that they offer two <unk> the death rate was 70 percent or more, not as high as I wanted to.     target: So if you look at the extremes,  those plans that offered you two funds,  participation rates were around in the mid-70s --  still not as high as we want it to be.
translate: And in the plans that would offer about 60 funding, the rate of participation led to the 1960s.     target: In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,  participation rates have now dropped  to about the 60th percentile.
translate: It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there is more options, even in that case, there is negative consequences.     target: Now it turns out  that even if you do choose to participate  when there are more choices present,  even then, it has negative consequences.
translate: So for the people who decided to participate, how much more we were the number of choices, more people <unk> to avoid the actions or hedge funds.     target: So for those people who did choose to participate,  the more choices available,  the more likely people were  to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.
translate: In the time there would be more choices, they were more willing to invest on financial <unk>     target: The more choices available,  the more likely they were  to put all their money in pure money market accounts.
translate: But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.     target: Now neither of these extreme decisions  are the kinds of decisions  that any of us would recommend for people  when you're considering their future financial well-being.
translate: In the previous decade we've seen three negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities.     target: Well, over the past decade,  we have observed three main negative consequences  to offering people more and more choices.
translate: The most likely to make the decision that <unk> even when this is against interest.     target: They're more likely to delay choosing --  procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.
translate: It's more likely to make the worst decisions in finance and health.     target: They're more likely to make worse choices --  worse financial choices, medical choices.
translate: They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though you notice it better.     target: They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,  even when they do objectively better.
translate: The main reason is that we <unk> by looking at that huge range of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations in order to contrast them to contrast and choose of that amazing <unk>     target: The main reason for this  is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls  of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,  but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting  and actually picking from that stunning display.
translate: Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we've done in one way, or another, in different research, so that you can test in their business.     target: So what I want to propose to you today  are four simple techniques --  techniques that we have tested in one way or another  in different research venues --  that you can easily apply  in your businesses.
translate: The first is, <unk>     target: The first: Cut.
translate: You've ever heard before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than today.     target: You've heard it said before,  but it's never been more true than today,  that less is more.

translate: In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle better choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard.     target: Now in the financial savings world,  I think one of the best examples that has recently come out  on how to best manage the choice offerings  has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,  which was the program that they have at Harvard.

translate: Because the images made it make it more real.     target: Because the pictures made it feel  more real to you.
translate: This brings me to the second technique to run the problem of <unk> which is <unk>     target: Which brings me to the second technique  for handling the choice overload problem,  which is concretization.
translate: For people understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences should feel very <unk>     target: That in order for people to understand  the differences between the choices,  they have to be able to understand  the consequences associated with each choice,  and that the consequences need to be felt  in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.

translate: There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the difficult and dangerous, and there is no popular mechanics of science fiction like how to explore the solar system.     target: There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War,  no politician like John Kennedy  who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous,  and no popular science fictional mythology  such as exploring the solar system.
translate: In general going to the moon turned out to be simple.     target: Most of all, going to the moon  turned out to be easy.
translate: I was just three days.     target: It was just three days away.
translate: And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.     target: And arguably it wasn't even solving  much of a problem.
translate: We are alone in our present, and the solutions of the future are more difficult to get.     target: We are left alone with our day,  and the solutions of the future will be harder won.
translate: God knows that we are not all the challenges.     target: God knows, we don't lack for the challenges.
translate: Thank you very much.     target: Thank you very much.
translate: Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by <unk> the ideas that they have about trust.     target: So I'm going to talk about trust,  and I'm going to start by reminding you  of the standard views that people have about trust.
translate: They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.     target: I think these are so commonplace,  they've become clichs of our society.
translate: I think it's three.     target: And I think there are three.
translate: The first one is a <unk> there has been a huge decline of trust, and it's a very general belief     target: One's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust,  very widely believed.
translate: The second one is a possible, we should have more trust.     target: The second is an aim: we should have more trust.
translate: And the third is a <unk> we should be able to recover the trust.     target: And the third is a task: we should rebuild trust.
translate: I believe that the goal and the task is <unk>     target: I think that the claim, the aim and the task  are all misconceived.
translate: What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a most clear idea.     target: So what I'm going to try to tell you today  is a different story about a claim, an aim and a task  which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter.
translate: First of the <unk> why people think that trust has <unk>     target: First the claim: Why do people think trust has declined?
translate: And if I think I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.     target: And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence,  I don't know the answer.
translate: It tells me to think that there may be going down into some activities or institutions that could have increased in others.     target: I'm inclined to think it may have declined  in some activities or some institutions  and it might have grown in others.
translate: I don't have it.     target: I don't have an overview.
translate: But I can turn to Google polls and design surveys are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has <unk>     target: But, of course, I can look at the opinion polls,  and the opinion polls are supposedly  the source of a belief that trust has declined.
translate: When you look at the polls for the long time, there's no great evidence of it.     target: When you actually look at opinion polls across time,  there's not much evidence for that.
translate: That is, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>     target: That's to say, the people who were mistrusted  20 years ago,  principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.
translate: And the people who were highly reliable about 20 years ago, they are still pretty <unk> the nurses.     target: And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago  are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.
translate: The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half of the path.     target: The rest of us are in between,  and by the way, the average person in the street  is almost exactly midway.
translate: But this is this evidence of enough?     target: But is that good evidence?
translate: What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.     target: What opinion polls record is, of course, opinions.
translate: What else can you do it?     target: What else can they record?
translate: What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people have, when they ask certain questions.     target: So they're looking at the generic attitudes  that people report when you ask them certain questions.
translate: <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>     target: Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
translate: Now, if you ask you a little bit about the <unk>     target: Now if somebody said to you, "Do you trust greengrocers?
translate: Let's take it into the <unk>     target: Do you trust fishmongers?
translate: Tell me in the <unk> <unk>     target: Do you trust elementary school teachers?"
translate: <unk> by asking, "To do what?"     target: you would probably begin by saying, "To do what?"
translate: And that would be a very <unk> answer.     target: And that would be a perfectly sensible response.
translate: And you might say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but elsewhere.     target: And you might say, when you understood the answer to that,  "Well, I trust some of them, but not others."
translate: What it's very rational.     target: That's a perfectly rational thing.
translate: And ultimately, in real life, we tend to detect the confidence in a <unk> way.     target: In short, in our real lives,  we seek to place trust in a differentiated way.
translate: We don't assume the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or kind of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.     target: We don't make an assumption that the level of trust  that we will have in every instance of a certain type  of official or office-holder or type of person  is going to be uniform.
translate: I could, for example, to say that I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know I can give up the class, but not any way to lead the school <unk>     target: I might, for example, say that I certainly trust  a certain elementary school teacher I know  to teach the reception class to read,  but in no way to drive the school minibus.
translate: After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>     target: I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver.
translate: I could trust my friend more <unk> to maintain a conversation, but no, maybe, to keep a secret.     target: I might trust my most loquacious friend  to keep a conversation going  but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret.
translate: <unk>     target: Simple.
translate: And if we have those evidence in our everyday life in the way that trust is <unk> why we would stop all that knowledge when we think about trust in a <unk> way.     target: So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives  of the way that trust is differentiated,  why do we sort of drop all that intelligence  when we think about trust more abstractly?
translate: I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they're trying to do the good judgment to the fact that you actually trust something or somebody.     target: I think the polls are very bad guides  to the level of trust that actually exists,  because they try to obliterate the good judgment  that goes into placing trust.
translate: Second of all, what about the goal?     target: Secondly, what about the aim?
translate: The goal is to have more trust.     target: The aim is to have more trust.
translate: Frankly, I think it is stupid.     target: Well frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.
translate: It's not that the goal that I <unk>     target: It's not what I would aim at.
translate: I <unk> to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.     target: I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy  but not in the untrustworthy.
translate: In short, I'm a <unk> of not to trust what is not <unk>     target: In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.
translate: And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>     target: And I think, of those people who, for example,  placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff,  who then made off with them,  and I think of them, and I think, well, yes,  too much trust.
translate: Have more confidence is not a smart objective in this life.     target: More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.
translate: <unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.     target: Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust  is the proper aim.
translate: Once you say it -- he says, yes, that means that what it means at the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.     target: Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay,  that means that what matters in the first place  is not trust but trustworthiness.
translate: What it's about to make a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.     target: It's judging how trustworthy people are  in particular respects.
translate: And I think in order to make a trial, we're compelled to focus on three things.     target: And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.
translate: They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>     target: Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?
translate: And if we found that one person is <unk> in the raw commodities and it's responsible and honest, then we're going to have a really good reason to rely on it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.     target: And if we find that a person is competent  in the relevant matters,  and reliable and honest,  we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them,  because they'll be trustworthy.
translate: But if, in the contrary, they are not <unk> we couldn't trust them.     target: But if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.
translate: I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they are <unk>     target: I have friends who are competent and honest,  but I would not trust them to post a letter,  because they're forgetful.
translate: I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that you can get your own <unk>     target: I have friends who are very confident  they can do certain things,  but I realize that they overestimate their own competence.
translate: And I'm really glad to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>     target: And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends  who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.
translate: If this is that, I haven't got <unk>     target: If so, I haven't yet spotted it.
translate: But that's what we are <unk> to be able to believe that they trust.     target: But that's what we're looking for:  trustworthiness before trust.
translate: <unk> is the answer.     target: Trust is the response.
translate: <unk> is what we have to <unk>     target: Trustworthiness is what we have to judge.
translate: And of course, it's hard.     target: And, of course, it's difficult.
translate: In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, <unk> officials and so forth, and they make us easier the task to judge their trustworthiness.     target: Across the last few decades, we've tried to construct  systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions  and professionals and officials and so on  that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
translate: Many of these systems have had the opposite effect.     target: A lot of these systems have the converse effect.
translate: They don't work like <unk>     target: They don't work as they're supposed to.
translate: I remember once talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you will see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> which will be <unk>     target: I remember I was talking with a midwife who said,  "Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer  to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby."
translate: And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we <unk> that the <unk> system, which is meant to guarantee the <unk> and the <unk> evidence is actually doing the opposite.     target: And all over our public life, our institutional life,  we find that problem,  that the system of accountability  that is meant to secure trustworthiness  and evidence of trustworthiness  is actually doing the opposite.
translate: What they do is it <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard work, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.     target: It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks,  like midwives, from doing them  by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.
translate: You know all of you know similar examples.     target: You can all give your own examples there.
translate: <unk> all that for the target.     target: So so much for the aim.
translate: I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they were trusted to be worthy of trust and <unk> the people that we are reliable and if you were trying to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.     target: The aim, I think, is more trustworthiness,  and that is going to be different  if we are trying to be trustworthy  and communicate our trustworthiness to other people,  and if we are trying to judge whether other people  or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy.
translate: It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- which you don't do properly.     target: It's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction,  attitudes, don't do adequately here.
translate: Third, the task.     target: Now thirdly, the task.
translate: It takes the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.     target: Calling the task rebuilding trust, I think,  also gets things backwards.
translate: It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.     target: It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
translate: Well, we can do it with ourselves.     target: Well, we can do that for ourselves.
translate: We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.     target: We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
translate: We can do it if they're two people, they tried to improve trust.     target: We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.
translate: But the trust, in the end, is basically a signature because you give them other people.     target: But trust, in the end, is distinctive  because it's given by other people.
translate: You can't rebuild what other people have given you.     target: You can't rebuild what other people give you.
translate: You have to give them the foundation enough for you to trust you.     target: You have to give them the basis  for giving you their trust.
translate: You have to be worthy of trust.     target: So you have to, I think, be trustworthy.
translate: And that is, of course, because you can't ignore it by usually people, all the time.     target: And that, of course, is because you can't fool  all of the people all of the time, usually.
translate: But you also have to deliver <unk> evidence that you are worthy of trust.     target: But you also have to provide usable evidence  that you are trustworthy.
translate: So how do we do that?     target: How to do it?
translate: That's all a day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.     target: Well every day, all over the place, it's being done  by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions,  quite effectively.
translate: I'm going to give you a simple commercial example.     target: Let me give you a simple commercial example.
translate: The shop where I buy my socks says I can tell you that I can give you a little <unk>     target: The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back,  and they don't ask any questions.
translate: I carry them up and turn it for the money, or they change them for the color that I want.     target: They take them back and give me the money  or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.
translate: That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.     target: That's super. I trust them  because they have made themselves vulnerable to me.
translate: I think there's a big lesson in that.     target: I think there's a big lesson in that.
translate: If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust, and you have a trust in what you're saying.     target: If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party,  then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy  and you have confidence in what you are saying.
translate: So, at the end, I think that what we're pointing is not really hard to <unk>     target: So in the end, I think what we are aiming for  is not very difficult to discern.
translate: What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, they can figure out when and how the other person is worthy of trust.     target: It is relationships in which people are trustworthy  and can judge when and how the other person  is trustworthy.
translate: Thank you.     target: Thanks.
translate: From the early computers we have been <unk> to reduce the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>     target: Throughout the history of computers  we've been striving to shorten the gap between us  and digital information,  the gap between our physical world  and the world in the screen  where our imagination can go wild.
translate: This separation has been increasingly <unk> and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one bowl of the glass of the glass <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.     target: And this gap has become shorter,  shorter, and even shorter,  and now this gap is shortened down  to less than a millimeter,  the thickness of a touch-screen glass,  and the power of computing  has become accessible to everyone.
translate: But I ask myself, and if I wouldn't have any <unk>     target: But I wondered, what if there could be no boundary at all?
translate: And I started to figure out how to <unk>     target: I started to imagine what this would look like.
translate: So first I created this tool that goes into the digital space, so when the strong <unk> against the screen reaches its physical body to the table.     target: First, I created this tool  which penetrates into the digital space,  so when you press it hard on the screen,  it transfers its physical body into pixels.
translate: The designers can take their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs under the screen.     target: Designers can materialize their ideas  directly in 3D,  and surgeons can practice on virtual organs  underneath the screen.
translate: So with this tool that will break the barriers.     target: So with this tool, this boundary has been broken.
translate: But the two hands stay still out of the screen.     target: But our two hands still remain outside the screen.
translate: How do you get in the inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?     target: How can you reach inside and interact  with the digital information  using the full dexterity of our hands?
translate: In the <unk> division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital work.     target: At Microsoft Applied Sciences,  along with my mentor Cati Boulanger,  I redesigned the computer  and turned a little space above the keyboard  into a digital workspace.
translate: They <unk> a transparent <unk> with deep cameras to detect the fingers and your face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, reach inside of the 3D space, and grab out of your hands directly with your hands.     target: By combining a transparent display and depth cameras  for sensing your fingers and face,  now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard  and reach inside this 3D space  and grab pixels with your bare hands.
translate: As the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>     target: Because windows and files have a position in the real space,  selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf.
translate: You can move through the book and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual <unk> sensor that there are from every floating screen.     target: Then you can flip through this book  while highlighting the lines, words  on the virtual touch pad below each floating window.
translate: architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.     target: Architects can stretch or rotate the models  with their two hands directly.
translate: In these examples, we will <unk> in the digital world.     target: So in these examples,  we are reaching into the digital world.
translate: And if you invest the roles and we make digital information come towards us?     target: But how about reversing its role  and having the digital information reach us instead?
translate: We have a lot of us -- many of us will have bought and get things out of the Internet.     target: I'm sure many of us have had the experience  of buying and returning items online.
translate: Now that doesn't have to worry about.     target: But now you don't have to worry about it.
translate: What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.     target: What I got here is an online augmented fitting room.
translate: This is the vision that you get from a device in your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.     target: This is a view that you get from  head-mounted or see-through display  when the system understands the geometry of your body.
translate: So if we took this idea further, I thought, instead of only seeing pixels in space, how we can make them the physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>     target: Taking this idea further, I started to think,  instead of just seeing these pixels in our space,  how can we make it physical  so that we can touch and feel it?
translate: How would it be like that?     target: What would such a future look like?
translate: At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> <unk> we created this one <unk>     target: At MIT Media Lab, along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii  and my collaborator Rehmi Post,  we created this one physical pixel.
translate: This imam <unk> acts like a 3D <unk> in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.     target: Well, in this case, this spherical magnet  acts like a 3D pixel in our space,  which means that both computers and people  can move this object to anywhere  within this little 3D space.
translate: <unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>     target: What we did was essentially canceling gravity  and controlling the movement by combining  magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation  and sensing technologies.
translate: And by the way, the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and come back to reproduce and they stay in the physical world.     target: And by digitally programming the object,  we are liberating the object from constraints  of time and space, which means that now,  human motions can be recorded and played back  and left permanently in the physical world.
translate: Now you can teach <unk> physically and distance and the famous shot by Michael Jordan, you can play it as a physical reality of the time we want.     target: So choreography can be taught physically over distance  and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated  over and over as a physical reality.
translate: Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the top of the planets, the physics, and unlike the <unk> or the textbooks -- this is a real real experience and feel that you can play and feel.     target: Students can use this as a tool  to learn about the complex concepts  such as planetary motion, physics,  and unlike computer screens or textbooks,  this is a real, tangible experience  that you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful.
translate: But what's most fascinating to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.     target: And what's more exciting  than just turning what's currently in the computer physical  is to start imagining how programming the world  will alter even our daily physical activities.
translate: You can see, digital information will not only show us something but start to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us that we need to be <unk> in our world.     target: As you can see, the digital information  will not just show us something  but it will start directly acting upon us  as a part of our physical surroundings  without disconnecting ourselves from our world.
translate: We start talking about this today talking about a barrier, but if you get that barrier, the only limit that you have is our imagination.     target: Today, we started by talking about the boundary,  but if we remove this boundary,  the only boundary left is our imagination.
translate: Thank you.     target: Thank you.

translate: And I find it with a new culture I also gave up to my habit of reading <unk>     target: Encountering a new culture also started my habit  of comparative reading.
translate: They have a lot of perspectives.     target: It offers many insights.
translate: For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me because this was what students in China learn.     target: For example, I found this map out of place at first  because this is what Chinese students grew up with.
translate: I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the middle of the world.     target: It had never occurred to me,  China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.
translate: So a map involves the perspective of people.     target: A map actually carries somebody's view.

translate: And here is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't really have a lot to say.     target: And here, the standard paradigm  of emergence,  even the standard paradigms of neuroscience,  don't really, so far, have that much to say.
translate: I am a <unk> scientist of heart.     target: Now, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.
translate: I want a scientific theory of <unk> that it works for a long time, <unk> my head on the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in <unk> <unk> terms that will work.     target: I want a scientific theory of consciousness  that works,  and for a long time, I banged my head  against the wall  looking for a theory of consciousness  in purely physical terms  that would work.
translate: But at the end of the end, I got to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.     target: But I eventually came to the conclusion  that that just didn't work for systematic reasons.
translate: I think we will tell us about this point.     target: So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.
translate: We have a wonderful product chain, great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains the biology explains part of psychology.     target: We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation,  we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry,  chemistry explains biology,  biology explains parts of psychology.
translate: But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.     target: But consciousness  doesn't seem to fit into this picture.
translate: On one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.     target: On the one hand, it's a datum  that we're conscious.
translate: For each other, we don't know how to get that idea to our scientific view of the world.     target: On the other hand, we don't know how  to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world.
translate: I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our worldview of the world, but we don't know how.     target: So I think consciousness right now  is a kind of anomaly,  one that we need to integrate  into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.
translate: With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at early <unk> <unk> before I can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.     target: Faced with an anomaly like this,  radical ideas may be needed,  and I think that we may need one or two ideas  that initially seem crazy  before we can come to grips with consciousness  scientifically.
translate: There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.     target: Now, there are a few candidates  for what those crazy ideas might be.
translate: My friend Dan Chicken, who's here today, he has one.     target: My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
translate: His crazy idea is that there is no such a hard problem of consciousness.     target: His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem  of consciousness.
translate: All the idea of the subjective subjective film includes kind of illusion or confusion.     target: The whole idea of the inner subjective movie  involves a kind of illusion or confusion.
translate: In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the brain functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and so they study everything that needs explanation.     target: Actually, all we've got to do is explain  the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,  and then we've explained everything  that needs to be explained.
translate: Well, more power for him.     target: Well I say, more power to him.
translate: That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.     target: That's the kind of radical idea  that we need to explore  if you want to have a purely reductionist  brain-based theory of consciousness.
translate: At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the awareness of consciousness is <unk>     target: At the same time, for me and for many other people,  that view is a bit too close to simply  denying the datum of consciousness  to be satisfactory.
translate: But I'm going in a different direction.     target: So I go in a different direction.
translate: In the time you left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>     target: In the time remaining,  I want to explore two crazy ideas  that I think may have some promise.
translate: The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.     target: The first crazy idea  is that consciousness is fundamental.
translate: The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a technical building space, the space and the mass.     target: Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe  as fundamental building blocks:  space and time and mass.
translate: We see fundamental laws that <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.     target: They postulate fundamental laws governing them,  like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.
translate: These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more basic ones.     target: These fundamental properties and laws  aren't explained in terms of anything more basic.
translate: Rather, it is fundamental -- you think about it, and in there it is the world.     target: Rather, they're taken as primitive,  and you build up the world from there.
translate: Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>     target: Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.
translate: In the 19th century <unk> I discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, <unk> laws of Newton. So I <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental notion that those <unk> <unk>     target: In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out  that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena  in terms of the existing fundamentals   space, time, mass, Newton's laws   so he postulated fundamental laws  of electromagnetism  and postulated electric charge  as a fundamental element  that those laws govern.
translate: I think that's the situation that we find out of consciousness.     target: I think that's the situation we're in  with consciousness.
translate: If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, time, <unk> <unk> then because of logic -- the list.     target: If you can't explain consciousness  in terms of the existing fundamentals   space, time, mass, charge   then as a matter of logic, you need to expand the list.
translate: The more natural it would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.     target: The natural thing to do is to postulate  consciousness itself as something fundamental,  a fundamental building block of nature.
translate: It doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.     target: This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it.
translate: It opens up the road to do scientifically.     target: This opens up the way for you to do science with it.
translate: So what we need to do is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, the mass, physical processes.     target: What we then need is to study  the fundamental laws governing consciousness,  the laws that connect consciousness  to other fundamentals: space, time, mass,  physical processes.
translate: The physicists sometimes say that we want to do fundamental laws that we can get them into a <unk>     target: Physicists sometimes say  that we want fundamental laws so simple  that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.
translate: The situation of consciousness is something like this.     target: Well I think something like that is the situation  we're in with consciousness.
translate: We want to find the very simple laws that we can see them in a t-shirt.     target: We want to find fundamental laws so simple  we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.
translate: We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're going on.     target: We don't know what those laws are yet,  but that's what we're after.
translate: The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.     target: The second crazy idea  is that consciousness might be universal.
translate: Every system can have a degree of consciousness.     target: Every system might have some degree  of consciousness.
translate: This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> all over all, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious -- not only humans, dogs, <unk> even the microbes of Rob <unk> elementary particles.     target: This view is sometimes called panpsychism:  pan for all, psych for mind,  every system is conscious,  not just humans, dogs, mice, flies,  but even Rob Knight's microbes,  elementary particles.
translate: Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.     target: Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.
translate: The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>     target: The idea is not that photons are intelligent  or thinking.
translate: It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.     target: It's not that a photon  is wracked with angst  because it's thinking, "Aww, I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light.
translate: I can never even slow down and smell the <unk>     target: I never get to slow down and smell the roses."
translate: No, I don't.     target: No, not like that.
translate: But the thinking is that maybe photons may have some element of <unk> <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.     target: But the thought is maybe photons might have  some element of raw, subjective feeling,  some primitive precursor to consciousness.
translate: This might sound a little crazy for you.     target: This may sound a bit kooky to you.
translate: How would anybody think something so <unk>     target: I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?
translate: This is part of the first crazy idea that consciousness is critical.     target: Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea,  that consciousness is fundamental.
translate: If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it is natural to assume that it can also be universal as the others.     target: If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,  it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,  the way they are.
translate: It's also worth noticing that if the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more about nature.     target: It's also worth noting that although the idea  seems counterintuitive to us,  it's much less counterintuitive to people  from different cultures,  where the human mind is seen as much more  continuous with nature.
translate: A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that make the thought with the physical process, is to <unk> consciousness with information.     target: A deeper motivation comes from the idea that  perhaps the most simple and powerful way  to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness  to physical processing  is to link consciousness to information.
translate: Whenever there are information processing there -- there's consciousness.     target: Wherever there's information processing,  there's consciousness.
translate: <unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, complex recovery.     target: Complex information processing, like in a human,  complex consciousness.
translate: <unk> of simple information, simple <unk>     target: Simple information processing,  simple consciousness.
translate: A very exciting thing is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and I developed <unk> with <unk> methods.     target: A really exciting thing is in recent years  a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,  has taken this kind of theory  and developed it rigorously  with a mathematical theory.
translate: It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.     target: He has a mathematical measure  of information integration  which he calls phi,  measuring the amount of information  integrated in a system.
translate: And I'm supposed to have to do with consciousness.     target: And he supposes that phi goes along  with consciousness.
translate: So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high grade of <unk>     target: So in a human brain,  incredibly large amount of information integration,  high degree of phi,  a whole lot of consciousness.
translate: So in a mouse there is a standard of information integration of information, just equal degree of consciousness of awareness.     target: In a mouse, medium degree of information integration,  still pretty significant,  pretty serious amount of consciousness.
translate: But when you get to the <unk> microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>     target: But as you go down to worms,  microbes, particles,  the amount of phi falls off.
translate: The level of information integration is <unk> but it's not zero either.     target: The amount of information integration falls off,  but it's still non-zero.
translate: In the theory of <unk> there is still going to be a different level of <unk> to zero.     target: On Tononi's theory,  there's still going to be a non-zero degree  of consciousness.
translate: It actually provides a fundamental law of the high grade of <unk> high degree of consciousness.     target: In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law  of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.
translate: In addition, another reason is, <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into physical world.     target: Another final motivation is that  panpsychism might help us to integrate  consciousness into the physical world.
translate: The physicists and the philosophers often have observed that the physics is curiously abstract.     target: Physicists and philosophers have often observed  that physics is curiously abstract.
translate: It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that's underneath.     target: It describes the structure of reality  using a bunch of equations,  but it doesn't tell us about the reality  that underlies it.
translate: As he explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>     target: As Stephen Hawking puts it,  what puts the fire into the equations?
translate: From <unk> vision, the physics of physics you can leave as they are, but you can use them to describe the flow of consciousness.     target: Well, on the panpsychist view,  you can leave the equations of physics as they are,  but you can take them to be describing  the flux of consciousness.
translate: That is what the physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.     target: That's what physics really is ultimately doing,  describing the flux of consciousness.
translate: According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts a fire on the equations.     target: On this view, it's consciousness  that puts the fire into the equations.
translate: In that vision, consciousness is not being found out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>     target: On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle  outside the physical world  as some kind of extra.
translate: It's right there in the center.     target: It's there right at its heart.
translate: This vision of vision, I believe, <unk> vision has the potential for <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical implications     target: This view, I think, the panpsychist view,  has the potential to transfigure our relationship  to nature,  and it may have some pretty serious social  and ethical consequences.
translate: Some can be <unk>     target: Some of these may be counterintuitive.
translate: I used to think that I should not eat nothing I had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>     target: I used to think I shouldn't eat anything  which is conscious,  so therefore I should be vegetarian.
translate: If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.     target: Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view,  you're going to go very hungry.
translate: I think I think about this, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in a ethical terms and the moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.     target: So I think when you think about it,  this tends to transfigure your views,  whereas what matters for ethical purposes  and moral considerations,  not so much the fact of consciousness,  but the degree and the complexity of consciousness.
translate: It's also natural to ask by consciousness in other systems, like computers.     target: It's also natural to ask about consciousness  in other systems, like computers.
translate: What about the <unk> artificial intelligence system.     target: What about the artificially intelligent system  in the movie "Her," Samantha?
translate: It's <unk>     target: Is she conscious?
translate: According to the vision of information <unk> she has a complicated information processing <unk> so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious     target: Well, if you take the informational,  panpsychist view,  she certainly has complicated information processing  and integration,  so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.
translate: If this is right, if this is the right -- the very serious ethical problems about the ethic of smart computers -- smart computers and the ethic of <unk>     target: If that's right, it raises pretty serious  ethical issues about both the ethics  of developing intelligent computer systems  and the ethics of turning them off.
translate: Finally, you can ask by the consciousness of collective collective <unk> the planet.     target: Finally, you might ask about the consciousness  of whole groups,  the planet.
translate: Canada has its own <unk>     target: Does Canada have its own consciousness?
translate: Or at a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED talk, we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal movie for this full group of the inner movies, different from the internal films of each of the <unk>     target: Or at a more local level,  does an integrated group  like the audience at a TED conference,  are we right now having a collective TED consciousness,  an inner movie  for this collective TED group  which is distinct from the inner movies  of each of our parts?
translate: I don't know the answer to that question, but I think that at least it's a question you should take seriously.     target: I don't know the answer to that question,  but I think it's at least one  worth taking seriously.
translate: So this is <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.     target: Okay, so this panpsychist vision,  it is a radical one,  and I don't know that it's correct.
translate: I'm actually more secure from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second, which is universal.     target: I'm actually more confident about  the first crazy idea,  that consciousness is fundamental,  than about the second one,  that it's universal.
translate: And the vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love it.     target: I mean, the view raises any number of questions,  has any number of challenges,  like how do those little bits  of consciousness add up  to the kind of complex consciousness  we know and love.
translate: If we can answer those questions, so I think we're going through the right path to a theory of serious awareness.     target: If we can answer those questions,  then I think we're going to be well on our way  to a serious theory of consciousness.
translate: If not, well, probably this is the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.     target: If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps  in science and philosophy.
translate: We can't expect to solve the night in the morning.     target: We can't expect to solve it overnight.
translate: But I think we eventually will be going to find it.     target: But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.
translate: Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.     target: Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think,  both to understanding the universe  and to understanding ourselves.
translate: Maybe we only need the crazy idea.     target: It may just take the right crazy idea.
translate: Thank you.     target: Thank you.

translate: And my parents said, "Well, that is very nice, but there is a terrible problem.     target: And my parents said, "Hm, that's really nice,  but there's kind of one glaring problem with that.
translate: She's actually not really got anything."     target: She hasn't actually achieved anything."   And they were right, you know.
translate: And I went to school, I had good notes. In school, I had a under profile <unk> in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>     target: I went to school, I got good marks,  I had a very low-key after school job  in my mum's hairdressing salon,  and I spent a lot of time watching  "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Dawson's Creek."
translate: Yeah, I know that. What a contradiction.     target: Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.

translate: I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.     target: I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary  at all.
translate: Nothing that can be considered if we take the disability outside of the equation.     target: I wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement  if you took disability out of the equation.
translate: Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school at <unk> so just after 20 minutes in the early 11 minutes in the <unk> of <unk> studies -- a guy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when raise your <unk>     target: Years later, I was on my second teaching round  in a Melbourne high school,  and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class  when this boy put up his hand and said,  "Hey miss, when are you going to start doing your speech?"

translate: "Please, usually in the classroom.     target: "It's usually in the big hall."
translate: And so it was when I realized, this little child had been working with individuals with disability as objects.     target: And that's when it dawned on me:  This kid had only ever experienced disabled people  as objects of inspiration.
translate: And we don't. And it's not <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.     target: We are not, to this kid --  and it's not his fault, I mean,  that's true for many of us.
translate: For we, <unk> people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>     target: For lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers  or our doctors or our manicurists.
translate: We're not real people, we are there for us.     target: We're not real people. We are there to inspire.
translate: And, in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair and probably you are waiting for you to love them, right?  Yes.  Yes.     target: And in fact, I am sitting on this stage  looking like I do in this wheelchair,  and you are probably kind of expecting me  to inspire you. Right?   Yeah.
translate: Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk> <unk>     target: Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid  I'm going to disappoint you dramatically.
translate: I'm not here for <unk>     target: I am not here to inspire you.

translate: Yes, you've got the lie that disability is something that disability is <unk> and <unk> <unk>     target: Yeah, we've been sold the lie  that disability is a Bad Thing, capital B, capital T.
translate: It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you fantastic <unk>     target: It's a bad thing, and to live with a disability  makes you exceptional.
translate: It's not something bad and you can't make you <unk>     target: It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't  make you exceptional.
translate: And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.     target: And in the past few years, we've been able  to propagate this lie even further  via social media.
translate: You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>     target: You may have seen images like this one:  "The only disability in life is a bad attitude."

translate: These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.     target: These are just a couple of examples,  but there are a lot of these images out there.
translate: You can have seen one, from the girl with no hands drawing with a pencil <unk> by the mouth.     target: You know, you might have seen the one,  the little girl with no hands  drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.
translate: You may have seen a child running with a carbon fiber <unk>     target: You might have seen a child running  on carbon fiber prosthetic legs.
translate: And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call inspiration <unk>     target: And these images,  there are lots of them out there,  they are what we call inspiration porn.
translate: And we use the <unk> porn term, because they <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.     target: And I use the term porn deliberately,  because they objectify one group of people  for the benefit of another group of people.
translate: So in this case, it will teach the <unk> to the benefit of people without disability.     target: So in this case, we're objectifying disabled people  for the benefit of nondisabled people.
translate: So the purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad that my life, it might be worse.     target: The purpose of these images  is to inspire you, to motivate you,  so that we can look at them  and think, "Well, however bad my life is,  it could be worse.
translate: I could be that person.     target: I could be that person."
translate: But if you're that person?     target: But what if you are that person?

translate: It was as if I stood in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>     target: They were just kind of congratulating me  for managing to get up in the morning  and remember my own name.   And it is objectifying.
translate: These images, those images <unk> people with disability on the benefit of people without disability.     target: These images, those images  objectify disabled people  for the benefit of nondisabled people.
translate: They are there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.     target: They are there so that you can look at them  and think that things aren't so bad for you,  to put your worries into perspective.
translate: And life as a legal person is actually something hard.     target: And life as a disabled person  is actually somewhat difficult.
translate: We get a few things.     target: We do overcome some things.
translate: But the things that we <unk> are not the things that you can think.     target: But the things that we're overcoming  are not the things that you think they are.
translate: They are not relative to our bodies.     target: They are not things to do with our bodies.
translate: I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I <unk> the the social model of <unk> which tells us we are more likely because of the society that we live than because of our bodies or <unk>     target: I use the term "disabled people" quite deliberately,  because I subscribe to what's called the social model of disability,  which tells us that we are more disabled  by the society that we live in  than by our bodies and our diagnoses.
translate: So I've lived in this body for a long time.     target: So I have lived in this body a long time.
translate: I'm very <unk> with him.     target: I'm quite fond of it.
translate: It makes the things that I need to do, and I have learned how to take the best of their ability to how you do, and that's what happens with kids of those pictures as well.     target: It does the things that I need it to do,  and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity  just as you have,  and that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well.
translate: They're not doing anything out of common.     target: They're not doing anything out of the ordinary.
translate: They're simply using their bodies taking the best of their capacity.     target: They are just using their bodies  to the best of their capacity.
translate: So is it really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>     target: So is it really fair to objectify them  in the way that we do,  to share those images?
translate: When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as <unk>     target: People, when they say, "You're an inspiration,"  they mean it as a compliment.

translate: And so a few years ago, I had a program to try and understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.     target: And so, several years ago,  I undertook a program to try to understand  the fundamental physical mechanisms  underlying intelligence.
translate: So I'll go back a step.     target: Let's take a step back.
translate: We first start with a mental experiment.     target: Let's first begin with a thought experiment.
translate: So imagine that you're from an <unk> race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth and the intelligence of the Earth, but you have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you     target: Pretend that you're an alien race  that doesn't know anything about Earth biology  or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence,  but you have amazing telescopes  and you're able to watch the Earth,  and you have amazingly long lives,  so you're able to watch the Earth  over millions, even billions of years.
translate: And you see a very strange effect.     target: And you observe a really strange effect.
translate: Of course, as a <unk> we know the reason that we are trying to save ourselves.     target: Now of course, as earthlings,  we know the reason would be  that we're trying to save ourselves.
translate: We're trying to avoid an impact.     target: We're trying to prevent an impact.
translate: But if you're an alien race that knows nothing about this, that doesn't have any concept of intelligence on Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory to explain how, to a certain time in the time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet <unk>     target: But if you're an alien race  who doesn't know any of this,  doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence,  you'd be forced to put together  a physical theory that explains how,  up until a certain point in time,  asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet  mysteriously stop doing that.
translate: And so I claim that this is the same question of understanding the physical nature of intelligence.     target: And so I claim that this is the same question  as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
translate: So in this program that he took over many years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines -- that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.     target: So in this program that I undertook several years ago,  I looked at a variety of different threads  across science, across a variety of disciplines,  that were pointing, I think,  towards a single, underlying mechanism  for intelligence.
translate: In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be immersed in the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.     target: In cosmology, for example,  there have been a variety of different threads of evidence  that our universe appears to be finely tuned  for the development of intelligence,  and, in particular, for the development  of universal states  that maximize the diversity of possible futures.

translate: And so taking all of these different topics and <unk> together, and he said, for several years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all of these different <unk>     target: And so, taking all of these different threads  and putting them together,  I asked, starting several years ago,  is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence  that we can factor out  of all of these different threads?
translate: Is there just a equation for <unk>     target: Is there a single equation for intelligence?
translate: And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.     target: And the answer, I believe, is yes. ["F = T  S"]  What you're seeing is probably  the closest equivalent to an E = mc  for intelligence that I've seen.
translate: So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a force, <unk> which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.     target: So what you're seeing here  is a statement of correspondence  that intelligence is a force, F,  that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.
translate: It acts for maximize the future freedom of action, or to maintain the open choices with a visual force with the diversity of possible future.     target: It acts to maximize future freedom of action,  or keep options open,  with some strength T,  with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S,  up to some future time horizon, tau.
translate: And in a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>     target: In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.
translate: <unk> tries to maximize the future freedom of action and to keep economic choices.     target: Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action  and keep options open.
translate: And so when you've seen this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?     target: And so, given this one equation,  it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?
translate: So how <unk> is it?     target: How predictive is it?
translate: <unk> the human intelligence level.     target: Does it predict human-level intelligence?
translate: <unk> <unk> intelligence.     target: Does it predict artificial intelligence?
translate: So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.     target: So I'm going to show you now a video  that will, I think, demonstrate  some of the amazing applications  of just this single equation.
translate: Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that make more <unk> or <unk> during their life should have possible conditions for the existence of smart beings for intelligent beings as us.     target: Narrator: Recent research in cosmology  has suggested that universes that produce  more disorder, or "entropy," over their lifetimes  should tend to have more favorable conditions  for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves.
translate: But what if that connection to <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence <unk> a more <unk> relationship.     target: But what if that tentative cosmological connection  between entropy and intelligence  hints at a deeper relationship?
translate: What if intelligent behavior is not just based on the production of <unk> in the long run, but actually actually emerges directly from her?     target: What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate  with the production of long-term entropy,  but actually emerges directly from it?
translate: To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system in which you find inside.     target: To find out, we developed a software engine  called Entropica, designed to maximize  the production of long-term entropy  of any system that it finds itself in.
